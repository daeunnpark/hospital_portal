# Hello it's Daeun
I'm working on test.py to replace first.py and add modularity to the project.<br />
I created test folder since it was too messy. <br />
test.py in test folder contains the main class, calling other files in test folder.<br />
I'm splitting first.py into test.py and other files and moving all eventlisteners to test.py.<br />

To test, run test.py <br />
test.py contains (so far):
- welcome_page.py (= class login_page in first.py)<br />
- login_or_register.py(signinorregister.py) <br />
